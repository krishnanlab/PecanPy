# PecanPy: A parallelized, efficient, and accelerated _node2vec(+)_ in Python

Learning low-dimensional representations (embeddings) of nodes in large graphs is key to applying machine learning on massive biological networks. _Node2vec_ is the most widely used method for node embedding. PecanPy is a fast, parallelized, memory efficient, and cache optimized Python implementation of [_node2vec_](https://github.com/aditya-grover/node2vec). It uses cache-optimized compact graph data structures and precomputing/parallelization to result in fast, high-quality node embeddings for biological networks of all sizes and densities. Detailed source code documentation can be found [here](https://pecanpy.readthedocs.io/).

The details of implementation and the optimizations, along with benchmarks, are described in the application note [_PecanPy: a fast, efficient and parallelized Python implementation of node2vec_](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab202), which is published in _Bioinformatics_. The benchmarking results presented in the preprint can be reproduced using the test scripts provided in the companion [benchmarks repo](https://github.com/krishnanlab/PecanPy_benchmarks).

**v2 update**: PecanPy is now equipped with _node2vec+_, which is a natural extension of _node2vec_ and handles weighted graph more effectively. For more information, see [*Accurately Modeling Biased Random Walks on Weighted Wraphs Using Node2vec+*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08031). The datasets and test scripts for reproducing the presented results are available in the [node2vec+ benchmarks repo](https://github.com/krishnanlab/node2vecplus_benchmarks).

## Installation

Install from the latest release with:

```bash
$ pip install pecanpy
```

Install latest version (unreleassed) in development mode with:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/krishnanlab/pecanpy.git
$ cd pecanpy
$ pip install -e .
```

where `-e` means "editable" mode so you don't have to reinstall every time you make changes.

PecanPy installs a command line utility `pecanpy` that can be used directly.

## Usage

PecanPy operates in three different modes – `PreComp`, `SparseOTF`, and `DenseOTF` – that are optimized for networks of different sizes and densities; `PreComp` for networks that are small (≤10k nodes; any density), `SparseOTF` for networks that are large and sparse (>10k nodes; ≤10% of edges), and `DenseOTF` for networks that are large and dense (>10k nodes; >10% of edges). These modes appropriately take advantage of compact/dense graph data structures, precomputing transition probabilities, and computing 2nd-order transition probabilities during walk generation to achieve significant improvements in performance.

### Example

To run *node2vec* on Zachary's karate club network using `SparseOTF` mode, execute the following command from the project home directory:

```bash
pecanpy --input demo/karate.edg --output demo/karate.emb --mode SparseOTF
```

### Node2vec+

To enable _node2vec+_, specify the `--extend` option.

```bash
pecanpy --input demo/karate.edge --output demo/karate_n2vplus.emb --mode SparseOTF --extend
```

**Note**: _node2vec+_ is only beneficial for embedding _weighted_ graphs. For unweighted graphs, _node2vec+_ is equivalent to _node2vec_. The above example only serves as a demonstration of enabling _node2vec+_.

### Demo

Execute the following command for full demonstration:

```bash
sh demo/run_pecanpy
```

### Mode

As mentioned above, PecanPy contains three main modes for generating node2vec random walks,
each of which is better optimized for different network sizes/densities:
| Mode | Network size/density | Optimization |
|:-----|:---------------------|:-------------|
| `PreComp` | <10k nodes, <0.1% edges | Precompute second order transition probabilities, using CSR graph |
| `SparseOTF` (default) | (≥10k nodes, ≥0.1% and <20% of edges) or (<10k nodes, ≥0.1% edges) | Transition probabilites computed on-the-fly, using CSR graph |
| `DenseOTF` | >20% of edges | Transition probabilities computed on-the-fly, using dense matrix |

#### Compatibility and recommendations

| Mode | Weighted | ``p,q!=1`` | Node2vec+ | Speed | Use this if |
|:-----|----------------|---------------|-----------|:------------|:--------|
|``PreComp``|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:dash::dash:|The graph is small and sparse|
|``SparseOTF``|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:dash:|The graph is sparse but not necessarily small|
|``DenseOTF``|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:white_check_mark:|:dash:|The graph is extremely dense|
|``PreCompFirstOrder``|:white_check_mark:|:x:|:x:|:dash::dash:|Run with ``p = q = 1`` on weighted graph|
|``FirstOrderUnweighted``|:x:|:x:|:x:|:dash::dash::dash:|Run with ``p = q = 1`` on unweighted graph|

### Options

Check out the full list of options available using:
```bash
pecanpy --help
```

### Input

The supported input is a network file as an edgelist `.edg` file (node id could be int or string):

```
node1_id node2_id <weight_float, optional>
```

Another supported input format (only for `DenseOTF`) is the numpy array `.npz` file. Run the following command to prepare a `.npz` file from a `.edg` file.

```bash
pecanpy --input $input_edgelist --output $output_npz --task todense
```

The default delimiter for `.edg` is tab space (`\t`), you many change this by passing in the `--delimiter` option.

### Output

The output file has *n+1* lines for graph with *n* vertices, with a header line of the following format:

```
num_of_nodes dim_of_representation
```

The following  next *n* lines are the representations of dimension *d* following the corresponding node ID:

```
node_id dim_1 dim_2 ... dim_d
```

### Development Note

Run `black src/pecanpy/` to automatically follow black code formatting.
Run `tox -e flake8` and resolve suggestions before committing to ensure consistent code style.
